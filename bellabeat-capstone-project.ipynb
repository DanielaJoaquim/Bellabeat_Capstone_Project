Background\n## 1.1 About the company\nBellabeat, co-founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, is a leading tech company crafting health-focused smart products with a keen aesthetic touch. It empowers women through data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health. Since 2013, Bellabeat has expanded globally, offering products through online retailers and robust digital marketing. In 2016, it opened worldwide offices, emphasizing digital marketing channels like Google Search, social media, and display ads. To further growth, Sršen has tasked the marketing analytics team to analyze smart device usage data, aiming to shape Bellabeat's marketing strategy. This data-driven approach reflects Bellabeat's commitment to enhancing women's well-being.\n\n## 1.2 Characters\n* **Urška Sršen**: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer\n* **Sando Mur**: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team \n* **Bellabeat marketing analytics team**: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Bellabeat’’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst,can help Bellabeat achieve them.\n\n\n## 1.3 Products\n* **Bellabeat app**: The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.\n* **Leaf**: Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\n* **Time**: This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness.\n* **Spring**: This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated throughout the day. The Spring bottle connects to the Bellabeat app to track your hydration levels.\n\n\n# 2. Ask\n## 2.1 Business Task \nThe primary objective is to gather valuable insights into how consumers utilize smart devices. Through a careful analysis of these devices, we aim to gain a better understanding of user behavior, preferences, and patterns. This will aid in the development of Bellabeat's marketing strategy and open new routes for growth opportunities.\n\n## 2.2 Stakeholders\n* **Urška Sršen**: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer.\n* **Sando Mur**: Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team.\n* **Bellabeat marketing analytics team.**\n\n# 3. Prepare\n## 3.1 About the dataset\n**Name**: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data\n\n**Source**: kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)\n\n**Content**:This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk \nbetween 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.\n\n**Data Integrity**: Given the constraints, such as a limited sample size of 30 users and the absence of demographic details, there's a potential for sampling bias. We cannot guarantee that this sample accurately reflects the entire population. Additionally, the dataset is outdated, and the survey spanned only two months, posing limitations. Consequently, we intend to adopt an operational approach in our case study to address these challenges.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4.
